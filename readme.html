dendritica-1.0, dendritica-1.1 and the documentation are now available
directly from ModelDB. Please note that these are the original versions
from 2001, which will not run without modifications on current versions
of NEURON. However, the source code may be useful as a collection of
algorithms for the analysis of structure-function relations in neurons.

Installation note:<br> Michael Hines had found that dendritica
worked at least in its interactive mode with a unix (and
linux) version (5.2) of Neuron by

<br><p />
1)installing iv as described at the neuron installation page<br>
2)after unpacking the nrn source code
change the  line <br>#if !defined(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)<br> to <br>#if defined(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)<br>
in ./nrn-5.2/src/ivoc/ivocvect.cpp<br>
3)finish the installation of neuron as usual.
<br><p />
Also note that dendritica "2. Getting Started"  instructions in "2.1 A sample session" has the
following changes for Neuron 5.2. After nrnivmodl is run in <br><p />
./dendritica-1.0/batch_back/back/mod/kvz_naz
<br><p /> the folder (e.g. sparc/ or i686/
i.e. named after your machine)  created by nrnivmodl, with all its contents and subdirectories, should be moved up to
the back/ directory.  Then to start Neuron and dendritica cd to the back/ directory and type<br><p />
nrngui gui.hoc
<br> <p />(a minus sign on the end of the command is not needed).<br><p />

<font face="Verdana">This page provides links to <i>Dendritica,</i> a package
of software tools for studying propagation of action potentials in dendrites,
to be used in conjunction with the simulator <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/">NEURON</a>.
The programs are based on those used for the simulations described in the
following paper:</font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1><a href="http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/2/926">Vetter,
P., Roth, A. &amp; H&auml;usser, M. </a>(2001). Action potential propagation
in dendrites depends on dendritic morphology. <i>Journal of Neurophysiology,</i>
85: 926-937.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i>Dendritica</i> is available as a complete package
which will enable you to interactively reproduce the simulations in the
paper. The programs have been written for the Linux or Unix environments,
and require <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/">NEURON
4.1.1</a>. You will need approximately 100 MB of disk space for the entire
installation. Note that to run all the programs successfully, you may also
need to make several minor modifications to the NEURON source code (see
documentation above).</font>
